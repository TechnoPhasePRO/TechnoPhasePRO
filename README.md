- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a software developer working in the startup industry, where I focus on building innovative web applications and crafting elegant solutions to complex problems. I'm passionate about creating software that improves lives and enhances user experiences.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently exploring the open-source world & contributing to different communities. As an open-source enthusiast, I believe in the power of collaboration and giving back to the community that has supported me throughout my career. I actively participate in hackathons, code challenges, and open-source events like Hacktoberfest to contribute to projects that make a positive impact.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with collaborating on exciting open-source projects. If you have a cool project that needs a hand, feel free to reach out! I'm always excited to be part of new initiatives and work alongside talented developers.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to software development and open-source contributions! Whether it's discussing best practices, reviewing code, or brainstorming ideas, I'm always up for a tech chat.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Feel free to drop me an email at yrajsingh0001@gmail.com. I'm open to networking and connecting with fellow developers, recruiters, and tech enthusiasts.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I love to learn and experiment with new technologies in my spare time! When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring physical fitness, listening to songs, and immersing myself in a good book or two.
